# Lustre v5.0.0 released!

Lustre's v4 release was the largest so far, marking the first version to move away
from React as the underlying runtime in favour of a custom implementation. In what
is hopefully not going to become a tradition, this release includes an even bigger
rewrite and a bunch of exciting new features!

This release also marks the expansion of Lustre's team, with the addition of
[Yoshi](https://bsky.app/profile/joshi.monster). Her input and contributions for
this release have been invaluable and many of the most impactful changes here are
thanks to her hard work!

## Performance improvements

A large part of this release has involved a complete rewrite of the runtime and
virtual DOM. This has resulted in significant performance improvements over v4!
Inspired by [Evan's original Elm benchmark](https://github.com/evancz/react-angular-ember-elm-performance-comparison),
we created a benchmark app to compare Lustre's performance against v4 and other
frameworks. Let's see how v5 stacks up against v4:

This release is nearly **three times as fast** as v4 in this benchmark app. The
results are incredibly promising when compared to other frameworks too, with Lustre
stacking up well against Elm v0.19.1 and React v19.1.0:

Both of these benchmarks were recorded on an M3 MacBook Air with 16GB of RAM
running Safari.

Lustre is now able to hold its own when pit up against contemparies like React
and Elm, and our production users should feel much more confident that Lustre is
ready to scale with them as they grow.

Of course, all benchmarks should be taken with a grain of salt, and this one is
no different. Importantly, each of the three benchmark apps are the "naive"
implementations of TodoMVC **with no use of optimisation techniques** like
memoization or `Html.Lazy`. This puts Lustre on even footing with the other
frameworks but also means that these results don't perfectly reflect the best
performance possible in those other frameworks.

In the coming weeks we'll release a more-comprehensive breakdown of the benchmark
and its methodology, as well as begin work on a `memo` optimisation to catch up
with the other frameworks!

## Growing up

It's been a little over a year since Lustre's v4 release, which marked the point
where Lustre stopped being a toy project and started being something I tried to
take seriously. Since then Lustre has grown tremendously: the number of GitHub
stars as increased by almost an order of magnitude, Lustre is one of the most
popular non-core Gleam packages, content creators have made videos about it, and
companies are betting their businesses on it!

With all that growth comes a fair bit of responsibility, and Lustre has a bit of
an infamous reputation for lacking tests. This release makes a huge step in the
right direction, with a suite of over 60 tests covering the core vdom and event
handling functionality.

We also have a robust benchmark app that gives us a good idea of how we pit up
against other frameworks, and helps make sure we're not taking step backwards in
performance.

The project definitely has a way to go and we're still looking for a good way to
test the runtime that isn't just "open a bunch of the examples and see if they
work," but hopefully this work will signal to more folks that Lustre is worth
their time and attention.

## Better support for HTML forms

A lot of Lustre's positioning as a framework is around making it easy for backend
developers to build more-interactive frontend experiences. A common question from
these folks is "how do I handle forms?" and typically the response has been that
you shouldn't need forms now that you control input state with your `Model` and
handle effects like HTTP requests in your `update` function.

While that is still the case, we were leaving a lot of great native functionality
on the table by eschewing forms entirely and made it harder for developers to
write semantic HTML.

To better-support the use of native HTML forms, Lustre now includes a **non-standard**
`detail.formData` property on submit events that contains a list of name-value
pairs for each form field. This neatly matches the format expected by packages
like [`formal`](https://hexdocs.pm/formal/) and the built-in `event.on_submit`
handler has already decoded this data for you:

```gleam
fn view_login() -> Element(Msg) {
  let handle_submit = fn(form_data) {
    form.decoding({
      use username <- form.parameter
      use password <- form.parameter

      LoginData(username:, password:)
    })
    |> form.with_values(form_data)
    |> form.field("username", form.string |> form.and(form.must_not_be_empty))
    |> form.field("password", form.string |> form.and(form.must_be_string_longer_than(8)))
    |> form.finish
    |> UserSubmittedLoginForm
  }

  html.form([event.on_submit(handle_submit)], [
    ...
  ])
}
```

Hopefully this both eases the curve for newcomers and lets more-experienced Web
developers get more out of the platform while using Lustre!

## New component functionality

Continuing on from better support for HTML forms, Lustre's components can now be
configured to participate in native HTML form submission thanks support for
[form-associated custom elements](https://web.dev/articles/more-capable-form-controls#form-associated_custom_elements).
Lustre components are built directly on top of the Custom Elements API and so when
the platform improves, Lustre does too! Form-associated custom elements allow
Lustre components to be used as form fields, with their value being submitted as
part of the form data.

To support these expanded configuration options, the `lustre.component` api has
been updated to accept a list of options rather than just a dictionary of attributes
to watch. Making a form-associated component is as simple as setting one option:

```gleam
let app = lustre.component(init:, update:, view:, options: [
  component.form_associated(True),
])
```

To control the value submitted in forms, you now have access to the
`component.set_form_value` and `component.reset_form_value` effects. Additionally,
there are options to handle cases such as the browser autofilling or restoring
your component's value automatically.

## Changes to event handlers

The event handler API has been updated to use the standard library's newer
`gleam/dynamic/decode` module and was the primary motivation for this major
release. This marks a shift from _imperative_ event handlers that receive the
event object directly, to _declarative_ handlers that provide just a decoder and
leave the rest up to the runtime.

```gleam
// Before:
event.on("mousemove", fn(event) {
  use x <- result.try(dynamic.field("offsetX", dynamic.int)(event))
  use y <- result.try(dynamic.field("offsetY", dynamic.int)(event))

  Ok(handle_mousemove(x, y))
})

// After:
event.on("mousemove", {
  use x <- decode.field("offsetX", decode.int)
  use y <- decode.field("offsetY", decode.int)

  decode.success(handle_mousemove(x, y))
})
```

The move to declarative event handlers means that `prevent_default` and `stop_propagation`
are now _modifiers_ that can be applied to an existing handlers. This also allows
server components to prevent the default behaviour of an event or stop its propagation.

In addition, Lustre now has **built-in support for event throttling and debouncing**,
allowing you to better control how often events are sent to your update function.
This is a boon for handling events like `scroll` and `mousemove` that can fire
very frequently but may not need to be handled at such a fine granularity. In
particular, server components will now be able to reduce the frequency of messages
sent over the wire, which is especially important for mobile devices and low bandwidth
connections.

```gleam
// A debounced event will only fire after it has "settled". That means if there
// is a burst of events, only the most recent event will be fired after the given
// delay:
//
//    original : --a-b-cd--e----------f--------
//   debounced : ---------------e----------f---
//
event.on_input(handle_input) |> event.debounce(500),
```

## And the rest

Besides the headlines, v5.0.0 also brings a bunch of smaller improvements too.
Server components can now communicate over Server-Sent Events (SSE) and HTTP
long polling, emit events when the component during the connection lifecycle, and
better handle low bandwidth connections.

The wrapper around fragments has been removed so once again calling `element.fragment`
will not add extra markup to the DOM, and `element.keyed` has been removed in
favour of a dedicated `keyed` module to prevent edge cases that could crop up in
the old api.

Lifecycle effects for `before_paint` and `after_paint` have been added to allow
you to better control when side effects are run compared to the browser's paint
cycle. This is especially useful for animations and transitions where you want to
read the DOM and re-render before the browser paints the screen.
