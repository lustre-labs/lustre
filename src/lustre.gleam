//// Lustre is a framework for rendering Web applications and components using
//// Gleam. This module contains the core API for constructing and communicating
//// with Lustre applications. If you're new to Lustre or frontend development in
//// general, make sure you check out the [examples](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/tree/main/examples)
//// or the [quickstart guide](./guide/01-quickstart.html) to get up to speed!
////
//// Lustre currently has three kinds of application:
////
//// 1. A client-side single-page application: think Elm or React or Vue. These
////    are applications that run in the client's browser and are responsible for
////    rendering the entire page.
////
//// 2. A client-side component: an encapsulated Lustre application that can be
////    rendered inside another Lustre application as a Web Component. Communication
////    happens via attributes and event listeners, like any other encapsulated
////    HTML element.
////
//// 3. A server component. These are applications that run anywhere Gleam runs
////    and communicate with any number of connected clients by sending them
////    patches to apply to their DOM.
////
////    There are two pieces to a server component: the main server component
////    runtime that contains your application logic, and a client-side runtime
////    that listens for patches over a WebSocket and applies them to the DOM.
////
////    The server component runtime can run anywhere Gleam does, but the
////    client-side runtime must be run in a browser. To use it either render the
////    [provided script element](./lustre/server_component.html#script) or use the script files
////    from Lustre's `priv/` directory directly.
////
//// No matter where a Lustre application runs, it will always follow the same
//// Model-View-Update architecture. Popularised by Elm (where it is known as The
//// Elm Architecture), this pattern has since made its way into many other
//// languages and frameworks and has proven to be a robust and reliable way to
//// build complex user interfaces.
////
//// There are three main building blocks to the Model-View-Update architecture:
////
//// - A `Model` that represents your application's state and an `init` function
////   to create it.
////
//// - A `Msg` type that represents all the different ways the outside world can
////   communicate with your application and an `update` function that modifies
////   your model in response to those messages.
////
//// - A `view` function that renders your model to HTML, represented as an
////   `Element`.
////
//// To see how those pieces fit together, here's a little diagram:
////
//// ```text
////                                          +--------+
////                                          |        |

////                                          +--------+

////                                            |    |
////                                        Msg |    | Model
////                                            |    |
////                                            |    v
////                                          +--------+
////                                          |        |
////                                          |  view  |
////                                          |        |
////                                          +--------+
//// ```
////
//// The `Effect` type here encompasses things like HTTP requests and other kinds
//// of communication with the "outside world". You can read more about effects
//// and their purpose in the [`effect`](./effect.html) module.
////
//// For many kinds of apps, you can take these three building blocks and put
//// together a Lustre application capable of running *anywhere*. Because of that,
//// we like to describe Lustre as a **universal framework**.
////
//// ## Guides
////
//// A number of guides have been written to teach you how to use Lustre to build
//// different kinds of applications. If you're just getting started with Lustre
//// or frontend development, we recommend reading through them in order:
////
//// - [`01-quickstart`](/guide/01-quickstart.html)
////
//// This list of guides is likely to grow over time, so be sure to check back
//// every now and then to see what's new!
////
//// ## Examples
////
//// If you prefer to learn by seeing and adapting existing code, there are also
//// a number of examples in the [Lustre GitHub repository](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre)
//// that each demonstrate a different concept or idea:
////
//// - [`01-hello-world`](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/tree/main/examples/01-hello-world)
//// - [`02-interactivity`](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/tree/main/examples/02-interactivity)
//// - [`03-controlled-inputs`](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/tree/main/examples/03-controlled-inputs)
//// - [`04-custom-event-handlers`](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/tree/main/examples/04-custom-event-handlers)
//// - [`05-http-requests`](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/tree/main/examples/05-http-requests)
//// - [`06-custom-effects`](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/tree/main/examples/06-custom-effects)
////
//// This list of examples is likely to grow over time, so be sure to check back
//// every now and then to see what's new!
////
//// ## Companion libraries
////
//// While this package contains the runtime and API necessary for building and
//// rendering applications, there is also a small collection of companion libraries
//// built to make building Lustre applications easier:
////
//// - [lustre/ui](https://github.com/lustre-labs/ui) is a collection of pre-designed
////   elements and design tokens for building user interfaces with Lustre.
////
//// - [lustre/ssg](https://github.com/lustre-labs/ssg) is a simple static site
////   generator that you can use to produce static HTML documents from your Lustre
////   applications.
////
//// Both of these packages are heavy works in progress: any feedback or contributions
//// are very welcome!
////
////
//// ## Getting help
////
//// If you're having trouble with Lustre or not sure what the right way to do
//// something is, the best place to get help is the [Gleam Discord server](https://discord.gg/Fm8Pwmy).
//// You could also open an issue on the [Lustre GitHub repository](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/issues).
////
//// While our docs are still a work in progress, the official [Elm guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org)
//// is also a great resource for learning about the Model-View-Update architecture
//// and the kinds of patterns that Lustre is built around.
////
//// ## Contributing
////
//// The best way to contribute to Lustre is by building things! If you've built
//// something cool with Lustre you want to share then please share it on the
//// `#sharing` channel in the  [Gleam Discord server](https://discord.gg/Fm8Pwmy).
//// You can also tag Hayleigh on Twitter [@hayleigh-dot-dev](https://twitter.com/hayleighdotdev)
//// or on BlueSky [@hayleigh.dev](https://bsky.app/profile/hayleigh.dev).
////
//// If you run into any issues or have ideas for how to improve Lustre, please
//// open an issue on the [Lustre GitHub repository](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/issues).
//// Fixes and improvements to the documentation are also very welcome!
////
//// Finally, if you'd like, you can support the project through
//// [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/hayleigh-dot-dev). Sponsorship
//// helps fund the copious amounts of coffee that goes into building and maintaining
//// Lustre, and is very much appreciated!

/// Represents a constructed Lustre application that is ready to be started.
/// Depending on where you want the application to run, you have a few options:
///
/// - Use [`start`](#start) to start a single-page-application in the browser.
///
///   This is the most common way to start a Lustre application. If you're new to
///   Lustre or frontend development in general, make sure you check out the
///   [examples](https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/tree/main/examples) or the
///   [quickstart guide]()
///
/// - Use [`start_server_component`](#start_server_component) to start a Lustre
///   Server Component anywhere Gleam will run: Erlang, Node, Deno, or in the
///   browser. If you're running on the BEAM though, you should...
///
/// - Use [`start_actor`](#start_actor) to start a Lustre Server Component only
///   for the Erlang target. BEAM users should always prefer this over
///   `start_server_component` so they can take advantage of OTP features.
///
/// - Use [`register`](#register) to register a component in the browser to be
///   used as a Custom Element. This is useful even if you're not using Lustre
///   to build a SPA.
///
/// If you're only interested in using Lustre as a HTML templating engine, you
/// don't need an `App` at all! You can render an element directly using the
/// [`element.to_string`](./lustre/element.html#to_string) function.
///
pub opaque type App(flags, model, msg) {
  App(
    init: fn(flags) -> #(model, Effect(msg)),
    update: fn(model, msg) -> #(model, Effect(msg)),
    view: fn(model) -> Element(msg),
    // The `dict.mjs` module in the standard library is huge (20+kb!). For folks
    // that don't ever build components and don't use a dictionary in any of their
    // code we'd rather not thrust that increase in bundle size on them just to
    // call `dict.new()`.

    // Using `Option` here at least lets us say `None` for the empty case in the
    // `application` constructor.
    //

/// The `ClientSpa` runtime is the most typical kind of Lustre application: it's
/// a single-page application that runs in the browser similar to React or Elm.
///
/// This type is used to tag the [`Action`](#Action) type to stop you accidentally
/// sending actions to the wrong kind of runtime.
///
pub type ClientSpa

/// A `ServerComponent` is a type of Lustre application that does not directly
/// render anything to the DOM. Instead, it can run anywhere Gleam runs and
/// operates in a "headless" mode where it computes diffs between renders and
/// sends them to any number of connected listeners.
///
/// Lustre Server Components are not tied to any particular transport or network
/// protocol, but they are most commonly used with WebSockets in a fashion similar
/// to Phoenix LiveView.
///
/// This type is used to tag the [`Action`](#Action) type to stop you accidentally
/// sending actions to the wrong kind of runtime.
///
pub type ServerComponent

/// An action represents a message that can be sent to a running Lustre application.
/// Code that is orchestrating an application where Lustre is only one part of the
/// system will likely want to send actions to the Lustre runtime. For most kinds of
/// application, you can usually ignore actions entirely.
///
/// The `msg` type parameter is the kind of messages you can send to the runtime's
/// `update` function through the [`dispatch`](#dispatch) action.
///
/// The `runtime` type parameter represents the type of Lustre application that
/// can receive this action. If we [`start`](#start) a typical Lustre SPA, we
/// get back the type `Result(fn(Action(msg, ClientSpa)) -> Nil, Error)`. This
/// means we can only send actions suitable for the [`ClientSpa`](#ClientSpa)
/// runtime, and trying to send actions like [`add_renderer`](#add_renderer) would
/// result in a type error.
///
pub type Action(msg, runtime)

/// Patches are sent by server components to any connected renderers. Because
/// server components are not opinionated about your network layer or how your
/// wider application is organised, it is your responsibility to make sure a `Patch`
/// makes its way to the server component client runtime.

///
/// Take a look at the [`simple`](#simple) application constructor if you want to
/// build something interactive.

/// **Note**: Lustre components are conceptually a lot "heavier" than components
/// in frameworks like React. They should be used for more complex UI widgets
/// like a combobox with complex keyboard interactions rather than simple things
/// like buttons or text inputs. Where possible try to think about how to build
