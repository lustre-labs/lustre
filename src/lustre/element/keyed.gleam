//// Lustre uses something called a _virtual DOM_ to work out what has changed
//// between renders and update the DOM accordingly. That means when you render
//// items in a list, Lustre will walk through the list of items and compare them
//// in order to see if they have changed.
////
//// This is often fine but it can be cause problems in cases where we'd like
//// Lustre to reuse existing DOM nodes more efficiently. Consider the example
//// in the [quickstart guide](../../guide/01-quickstart.html): each time the
//// counter is incremented, we insert a new image at the _start_ of the list.
////
//// Let's see how the virtual DOM handles this:
////
//// ```
//// Increment ->                 Increment ->
////              <img src="a">   -- update ->  <img src="b">
////                              -- insert ->  <img src="a">
//// ```
////
//// Beacuse the virtual DOM compares elements in order, it sees that the first
//// element has its `src` attribute changed from `"a"` to `"b"` and then sees
//// that a new element has been added to the _end_ of the list.
////
//// Intuitively, we know that what _really_ happened is that an element was
//// inserted at the _front_ of the list and ideally the first `<img />` should
//// be left untouched.
////
//// The solution is to assign a unique _key_ to each child element. This gives
//// Lustre enough information to reuse existing DOM nodes and avoid unnecessary
//// updates.
////
//// Keyed elements in Lustre work exactly like regular elements, but their child
//// list is a tuple of a unique key and the child itself:
////
//// ```gleam
//// keyed.div([], list.map(model.cats, fn(cat) {
////   #(cat.id, html.img([attribute.src(cat.url)]))
//// }))
//// ```
////
//// Let's see how the virtual DOM now handles this:
////
//// ```
//// Increment ->                 Increment ->
////                              -- insert ->  <img src="b">
////              <img href="a">  --        ->  <img src="a">
//// ```
////
//// We can see that Lustre has correctly recognised that the only change is a
//// new image being inserted at the front of the list. The first image is left
//// untouched!
